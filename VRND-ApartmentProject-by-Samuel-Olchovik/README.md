- This project took me around 15 to 20 hours to complete. However, much of that time was spent in blender trying to model, rig, animate, UV map and texture that Maneki-Neko cat that is waving in the corner. The project itself probably would have taken me around 5 to 10 hours to complete since I kept messing with lighting and the animation.
- I liked working with the animator and baked lighting. It's really cool how we can use lighting maps to give great lighting effects without putting a heavy load on our hardware.
- I used 3 different clips for the animation on the globe - a smooth start, steady-state spinning, and then a smooth finish. Getting these clips to play nice was a little frustrating. However, the most frustrating part was getting Unity to correctly use my blender animations and models (end tables and cat).
- NOTE: I created all sounds myself, so no citations necessary for these.
